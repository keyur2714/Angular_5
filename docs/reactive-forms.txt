- Angular uses three fundamental block to 
create angular reactive form 
that are 
FormControl, 
FormGroup and 
FormArray. 

FormControl: 
It is a class that is used to get and set values and 
validation of a form control 
such as <input> and <select> tag. 

FormGroup: 
It has the role to track value and 
validity state of group of FormControl. 

FormArray: 
It tracks the value and validity 
state of array of 
FormControl, FormGroup or FormArray 
instances. 

Two way to create Forms
Reactive Form: 
Creating form using FormControl, FormGroup 
and FormArray 
is said to be reactive form. 
They use ng module as ReactiveFormsModule. 

Template-Driven Form: 
Creating form using NgForm and NgModel, 
is said to be template-driven form. 
They use ng module as FormsModule. 

-ReactiveFormsModule and FormsModule 
both belong to @angular/forms library

-To use reactive form in our angular application, 
we need to configure ReactiveFormsModule 
in our application module

ex: 
import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
	
imports: [     	
ReactiveFormsModule
  ]

-FormControl is used to track values 
and validation of a form control
	name = new FormControl(); 
in template
	<input [formControl]="name"> 	

--
All the form control which are 
the instances of FormControl class,
 will be grouped using FormGroup class

Ex:
userForm = new FormGroup({
	name: new FormControl('Keyur, Validators.maxLength(10)),
	age: new FormControl(30, Validators.required),
	city: new FormControl(),
	country: new FormControl()
 }); 
in Html

<form [formGroup]="userForm" (ngSubmit)="onFormSubmit()">
 Name: <input formControlName="name"  placeholder="Enter Name">
 Age: <input formControlName="age"  placeholder="Enter Age">
City: <input formControlName="city"  placeholder="Enter City">
Country: <input formControlName="country" placeholder="Enter Country">
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
	 </form> 

onFormSubmit(): void {
  console.log('Name:' + this.userForm.get('name').value);
  console.log('Age:' + this.userForm.get('age').value);
  console.log('City:' + this.userForm.get('city').value);
  console.log('Country:' + this.userForm.get('country').value);
} 
-----------------Form Builder

FormBuilder creates reactive form with minimum code using FormGroup, FormControl and FormArray. FormBuilder has following methods. 
group(): Creates FormGroup. 
control(): Creates FormControl. 
array(): Creates FormArray. 
Ex: 



this.teamForm = this.formBuilder.group({
   teamName: ['', Validators.required ],
   teamManager: '',
   teamDept: this.formBuilder.group(new Department()),
   employees: this.formBuilder.array([]) 
});
